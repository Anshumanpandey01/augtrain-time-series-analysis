# AugTrain — Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project performs a complete time-series analysis on the AugTrain dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and baseline forecasting models to understand patterns, trends, and signals in the dataset.

The notebook contains step-by-step analysis to help interpret the time-based behavior of the data.

## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw time-series data  
- Analyze trends, seasonality, and anomalies  
- Generate visual insights using line charts and statistical plots  
- Build baseline forecasting approaches  
- Document reproducible and clear data analysis workflow
